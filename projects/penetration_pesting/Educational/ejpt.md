# Overview:
The eJPT course provided a comprehensive journey through penetration testing methodologies, covering essential aspects of host and network security alongside web application testing. Through practical exercises and theoretical insights, I gained valuable skills crucial for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.


# Course Topics Covered:

## Assessment Techniques:

- Mastering techniques for information gathering and enumeration to gather comprehensive insights into target systems.
- Conducting vulnerability assessments to identify and prioritize potential security vulnerabilities.
- Utilizing scanning tools like Nmap to conduct comprehensive network scans, identifying potential entry points and weaknesses.

## Exploitation and Post-Exploitation:

- Exploring various exploitation techniques for both host and network-based attacks.
- Leveraging industry-standard tools like Metasploit for automated exploitation and post-exploitation activities.
- Understanding the lifecycle of an attack from initial exploitation to maintaining access and covering tracks during post-exploitation.
- Implementing pivoting techniques to extend access and exploit additional systems within the target network.


## Tools:
- Hands-on experience with a variety of standard penetration testing tools such as Nmap, Burp Suite, Nessus, and Metasploit.
- Exploring the capabilities of each tool for efficient vulnerability identification, exploitation, and post-exploitation activities.

# Key Takeaways:
- Profound proficiency in conducting comprehensive security assessments using a variety of methodologies.
- Hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like Metasploit for efficient exploitation and post-exploitation.
- Enhanced understanding of web application security principles, enabling effective identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities.
